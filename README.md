## Repository structure

*!Note:*
- *the image does not contain MySQL preinstalled, use an official image of MySQL / MariaDB 
or any other database. Link the database container to the php's container*
- ***NodeJs** is not preinstalled, but it's stable repository is added to sources.list in the 
base image (`ubuntu/base` image)*

This is an blank image, has nothing worthy mentioning, except is has Ondre's php repo added 
and some helper libs.
